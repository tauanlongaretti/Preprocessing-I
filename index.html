    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a 27 year old student and web developer that loves video games and graphic design. Was accepted and graduated from an arts High School for visual arts with the highest math SAT score of the school. Ever since I can remember, I have been a gamer. Always competing at a high level no matter what game it is. One of my biggest achievement was to rank top 100 players in North America amongst millions for the biggest game of the momment called Fortnite. This led to the invitation for a tournament with $500,000 in prizer against the best players in the world. My dream is to become a well rounded software engineer and work for one of the biggest game development company in the world.</p>
